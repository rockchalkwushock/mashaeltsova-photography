## About

This has been a _work-in-progress_ for almost a year...no no I don't mean this repository, God that would be embarrassing! I told Masha I  would make her a website and over the last year the idea, the design, the what I wanted to do changed time and time again. Not until I put a hard deadline on the project and said this is what I will use and this is how I will do it _"problems be damned!"_ did this project come to life.

The real basis for me tackling this project came from a link sent to me for a photography website that a gentleman had promised to make her many years prior to us knowing each other. No lie at all I will never be able to make a website as visually stunning as this gentleman did, it's just not my skill set; however 9.5 minutes to load on a slow 3G connection with no caching: that I can do better on. So no, this website might not be the sleek and sexy beast that he offered, but in my mind if I can get a customer to your content in mere seconds then lack of sexiness should be less of a factor in converting the user to a customer.

So I approached this project from the standpoint of always looking and testing from a throttled environment in Chrome, usually opting for slow 3G. Having never been to Russia I have no idea what the end user's available connection speeds are nor how available that connection is so the goals were:

> 1. Make it fast.
> 2. Make it cache.

## Important Questions during Design & Development

When designing this site a few important questions needed to be answered:

> 1. How to deliver the high-resolution images effectively and efficiently to the end user who in 2017 will likely be viewing the product from a mobile device?

> 2. How to minimize the number of requests and/or size of data being communicated to that device and across the end user's network?

> 3. How to implement i18n since product's target audience are non-native English speakers?

> 4. Responsive images...**FML** :hankey:

It turns out I would be able to answer 3 of those questions with one answer and that solution was using the Cloudinary API. With Cloudinary I could store the original hi-res photos in the cloud and through combinations of flags/parameters create a dynamic url that would achieve 2 major things for me:

1. The image would be responsive,
2. The image would retain quality, but not be 10MB for a single request.

I had hoped that using a CSS Sprite would be possible as this would have cut down on the number of requests dramatically for the `/gallery` views; however I would not be able to deliver the best quality images in that case. Seeing as how this is a photography website I need to deliver the best quality as often as possible. Cloudinary does off the ability to create sprites and had my situation been different this would have been the route I would have taken.

Thankfully I did not have to learn Russian for this project to come together...mine is still quite meager! Also and very thankfully, there was an example of how to setup `react-intl` and `next` all while utilizing the server-side rendering feature of `next`. Should the end user's browser have a default language of Russian the server will render views in that language.
